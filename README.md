## About Peasium

Peasium is an easy-to-use web application framework. We believe development should be a fun, flexible, and creative experience. Peasium uses a simple bare-bones framework, so that developers do not need to spend all of their time and energy learning the framework and can instead focus on building new things.

## Development Environment

This framework is easiest to develop upon using Vagrant and VirtualBox. "Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past." -Vagrant

### Dependencies

Peasium aims to use as few dependencies as possible, allowing developers the freedom to augment their projects where needed. Peasium is developed using Ubuntu, Apache, and Php.
